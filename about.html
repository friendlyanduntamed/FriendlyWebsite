                    <p>
                        A 27-year-old amateur wildlife photographer currently based in Bangalore, originally from Kalyan
                        near Mumbai. I graduated from IIT Roorkee with a B.Tech in 2021, and since then, I've been
                        working at Goldman Sachs. Outside of spreadsheets and screens, however, my heart has always been
                        drawn to the quiet rhythms of the natural world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey into wildlife photography began unexpectedly. During my undergraduate years in
                        Roorkee, casual evening walks slowly turned into moments of birdwatching. What started as
                        curiosity became a true passion during the COVID years, when I bought my first DSLR using my
                        internship stipend and began observing birds from my own balcony, learning their calls, their
                        patterns, and their patience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving to Bangalore opened up an entirely new world. With its lakes, forest cover, and vibrant
                        wildlife communities, the city gave my hobby room to grow. I met people who shared the same
                        fascination, carpooled to early-morning trails, and explored places I had only read about
                        before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, I've been fortunate to visit several national parks, biosphere reserves, and
                        wildlife sanctuaries across India, including Sasan Gir, Ranthambore, Tadoba Andhari, Nagarhole,
                        and Periyar, as well as wildlife spaces across Southeast Asia, such as Khao Sok National Park in
                        Thailand, Son Tra Peninsula in Vietnam, and Kilim Geoforest in Malaysia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far, I've documented over 360+ species of birds, and while that number may not seem large, it
                        marks the beginning of a lifelong journey.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Friendly and Untamed</strong> reflects my relationship with the wild: one rooted in
                        respect, curiosity, and coexistence. Wildlife is often misunderstood, and human–nature conflict
                        has historically favored convenience over compassion. Through my work, I hope to tell the
                        quieter side of the story, the one where animals are not intruders, but rightful inhabitants of
                        landscapes that are steadily disappearing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This space is my way of giving back: by sharing stories, images, and moments from the wild, I
                        hope to foster awareness, empathy, and a deeper appreciation for the lives we share this planet
                        with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If these photographs encourage even a pause, an observation, a question, or a shift in
                        perspective, then this journey feels worthwhile.
